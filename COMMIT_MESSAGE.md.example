# Commit Message Guidelines

This file provides project-specific context for AI-generated commit messages.
Place this file as `COMMIT_MESSAGE.md` in one of these locations (searched in order):
1. Project root directory
2. `.git/` directory
3. `.github/` directory

## Project Context

This is a git commit history rewriter tool that helps developers improve their commit messages using AI.

## Commit Message Requirements

- Always use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- Scopes for this project: cli, hooks, providers, core, docs
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Write in present tense ("add" not "added")
- Focus on what and why, not how

## Project-Specific Guidelines

- When changing git hooks, mention which hooks are affected
- When updating providers, specify which AI provider (OpenAI/Ollama)
- Security-related changes should be clearly marked
- Breaking changes should include BREAKING CHANGE in the message

## Examples

Good commit messages for this project:
- `feat(hooks): add support for custom Ollama server URLs`
- `fix(core): prevent console output from contaminating commit messages`
- `docs(readme): add blog post link and improve security section`
- `refactor(providers): split provider implementations into separate files`

## Additional Notes

- This tool is security-sensitive as it handles git history
- Consider privacy implications when mentioning data handling
- Emphasize user control and opt-in features
